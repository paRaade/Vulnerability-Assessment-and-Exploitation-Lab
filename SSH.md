####  SSH (Port 22)

Currently the server uses password-based authentication for ssh. The default credentials msfadmin:msfadmin are also in use.
```
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa,ssh-dss msfadmin@192.168.100.22
msfadmin@192.168.100.22's password: 
Linux metasploitable 2.6.24-16-server #1 SMP Thu Apr 10 13:58:00 UTC 2008 i686

####  Remediation Steps
- Key based authentication for SSH should be used moving forward. The current ssh steup leaves the server open for brute force attacks
